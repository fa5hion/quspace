1. OVERVIEW

This program (QuSpace) is designed and implemented as part of my Master's
Thesis in the Faculty of Information and Natural Sciences at Aalto
Univercity School of Science and Technology.

The purpose of QuSpace is to provide access to widgets hosted at an
experimental widget platform called uSpace.

QuSpace is coded on top of Qt software framework and takes advantage of 
the WebKit Web browser engine in widget rendering. The server side
communication uses QJson library to parse the messages. QJson is available
at address http://qjson.sourceforge.net/.

2. COMPILE

To dynamically link against the QJson library it needs to be placed under
the lib subdirectory. Notes about building the platform specific QJson
library can be found from the previously mentioned WWW address.

Generate Makefile:
qmake

Build:
make

Optionally the project (quspace.pro) file can be opened in QtCreator IDE
that automates the build process.

3. RUN

The execution of QuSpace requires that the underlying operating system 
knows where to find the QJson library, e.g., /usr/lib/ in Linux. 
An other possibility is	to place the QJson library in the same directory 
where the QuSpace binary resides.
